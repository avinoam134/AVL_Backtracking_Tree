# Backtracking_AVL_Tree Data Structure
## About me
* Hi! Im Avinoam David and as for the time this project was written, I am a 1st year graduate in Computer Science degree, with an average score of 90.5
* This project was initiated by me to present a taste of my knowledge in data structures and modifying algorithms **with respect to efficiency**. 

## About the project
* The project is made due to the constantly changing nature of an AVL tree (in order to keep it balanced).
* The changes will allow a programmer to delete an inserted node (or insert a recently deleted one) in a way that will return the state of the tree to it's exact prior form.
* All changes were made in O(1) additional time complexity so that users can enjoy the updated structure's features with practically 0 costs in running time.
